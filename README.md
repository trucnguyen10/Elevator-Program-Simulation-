# Elevator-Program-Simulation-
This is a basic program I build for my Computer Science class using java. The program has 20 maximum passengers, you can add more further. The building has 20 maximum floors,. I made an algorithm that tell our elevator which passenger should be treated first, it is not a first come first served basis, just watch the video and you'll know the concept.
